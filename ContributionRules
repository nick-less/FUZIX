# Copilot

Microsoft co-pilot laundered code is not accepted in this project

# Licensing

Contributions should be made (and unless otherwise stated) will be assumed to be
under the same licensing as the project to which they pertain. You must have the
right to make the relevant licence grant. If there are good reasons to contribute
under a different license to a component please discuss first.

# Non-Free Dependencies

These are generally only acceptable where they are
- Redistributable objects of historical interest (eg the BCPL environment)
- Games or other redistributable creative works where the usual notion of open
  source does not necessarily make sense

Dependencies on proprietary tool chains or tooling will not be accepted.
