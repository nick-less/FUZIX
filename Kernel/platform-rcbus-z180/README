Fuzix for RCBUS Z180 systems booting from RomWBW

Based upon the N8VEM Mark IV port by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Required:
- Z180 CPU card (SC111, SC126, SC130, SC131, Z80.no #25d, #70a etc)
  18.432MHz clock is assumed (see kernel.def and devtty.c timing table)
- 512/512K memory card with RAM in the upper 512K (SC119 or similar)

Options:
 - RC2014 CF adapter at 0x10
 - SC126FIX CS expansion
 - Wiznet 5500 on SPI

Not yet supported but planned:
 - RC2014 serial/ctc interfaces (only the onboard ports are handled)
 - RC2014 TMS9918A

Not supported
 - RIZ180 (128K/128K RAM, different boot monitor)
 - SC111 with SCMonitor firmware

TODO:
 - Port over and test the SC111 turbo option

To set up

make diskimage
Write the disk.img file to disk
Boot ROMWBW and at the boot prompt give the number of the device to boot from
(SD or CF)

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

TODO:
- Add "turbo" option for clock doubling
- Add wait state control option for mem/io/cf wait states
- More CF testing
- Can we do CF with DMA1 ? (ought to get us to 3MBytes/second which is about the
PIO 0 limit with 0 mem 1 ide wait). 36MHz would get us closer to 6 but less
due to wait stating so probably ok as PIO1.
- Detect ROMWBW version and set baud rate


Platform Level Differences

RCBUS Z180
	SC111 and similar cards having a Z180 and ASCI based serial but
	without other features. We probe for an RTC at 0x0C but this is
	optional. IDE CF at 0x10 required.

SC126
	Enables the SPI SD card interface and WizNET 5500
	If you are using both an SD card and WizNET at once you must
	have a recent BIOS snapshot (not 3.0) or an SC126 SPI expander
	fitted. If your SD card doesn't properly leave the bus when not
	selected you'll need an SPI expander anyway. The LEDs are driven
	as blinkenlights.
	There is a mod for 1MB RAM which is also supported.

SC130:
	Only a single SPI CS is available. SD card is supported but you'll
	currently need to tweak the code to use W5500 instead as it assumes
	port 2 and the ROMWBW image doesn't report the SC126/30/31 differently.
	If you set it to use port 1 it should work fine.

Adding SPI support for other boards involves identifying how you will control
the CS signal and teaching the SPI code.
