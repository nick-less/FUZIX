TODO
- Verify the Z80_IO_BASE setting is correct
- Verify the memory bases are right and it boots
- Worry about the fact the PPIDE port arrangement is different
- Maybe - add SD support if the CSIO pins are exposed

This is Fuzix for the YAZ180 based upon the Z180 code by Will Sowerbutts
<will@sowerbutts.com>

Supported hardware:
 - PPIDE interface (TODO)
 - SD interface
 - RS232 serial port (ASCI channel 0, tty1)
 - RS232 serial port (ASCI channel 1, tty2)

The file "Kernel/platform-yaz180/fuzix.com" is a CP/M executable which
will load and boot the Fuzix kernel from within CP/M.

When booting the system from CP/M you can specify the root filesystem device on
the command line after the command name or unit number.

For example, with root filesystem on /dev/hdb1 (minor #17) at the CP/M command
prompt:

    A> FUZIX hdb1
or  A> FUZIX 17
