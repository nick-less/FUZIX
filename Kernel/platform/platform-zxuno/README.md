# Fuzix for the ZX Spectrum SE (Chloe) and ZX Uno

## Hardware

This port supports systems with a DIVMMC interface coupled with combined
128K and Timex MMU/Video. On the ZX Uno make sure the Timex MMU option is
enabled.

The platform currently enables the following devices
- Keyboard
- Video
- DIVMMC
- Fuller/Kempston joystick
- Kempston mouse

## Installation

To load we use the ESXDOS extension that is generally found with most
DivMMC and DivIDE interfaces. Copy FUZIX.BIN into / on the ESXDOS drive and
copy FUZIX into BIN. Then boot from ESXDOS with .fuzix

## Emulator

make diskimage
Boot from an ESXDOS enabled DIVMMC emulation

For Fuse use the Spectrum SE emulation. Zesarux will not run this code as it
has a various ZX Uno and DIVMMC emulation bugs.
