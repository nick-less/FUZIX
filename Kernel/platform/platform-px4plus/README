A FUZIX target for the PX4plus (and PX4 with either the 128K sidecar or a
RAM cartridge of at least 32K size).

The PX4Plus has 64K of RAM, and can overlay 6000-DFFF with one of two
different ROMpacks (usually 'basic' and 'utility'). Our kernel is a two
ROM set of 'P' type ROMs that can be plugged into the ROMpack sockets to
give a resident CP/M app that can be run as "B:FUZIX"


Banked Memory Map
-----------------

0x0000-0x00FF		Vectors (which IM ? PX8 is IM2)
0x0100-0x01FF		Needed by resident OS (or could rewrite bits and
			save them)
0x0200-0x5FFF		Kernel mappings
0x6000-0xDFFF		Switched segments 8/16/32K ROM x 2 or RAM
	0x6000-0xDFFF	Application space (32K) [need to use a bit under
			as 120K not 128K of swap]
	0x6000-0xDFFF	CODE1/CODE2
	0x6000-0xDFFF	CODE3/Video/FONT
	[ Do we want to generate interleaved banking or stubs in all banks ? ]
	[ Could also save space by putting CONST at the top of both ROM
	  images ? ]

0xE000-0xFBFF		Currently unused
0xFC00-0xFFFF		Framebuffer (2K)

We need to keep EF28 clear so we can set it to 1 for resident mode warm
start when we do suspend/resume.

Applications are switched to/from the 128K side car or built in 128K ramdisc
on the plus. Alternatively they can be switched to/from the 32K or 64K
cartridge module on the PX4 (or in theory both).

Storage I/O is via the serial floppy and/or optional ROM cartriges. The
floppy interface will also be usable for swap (once it works)

The PX-8 is different: There is only a single 32K system ROM, but no video
overhead. In theory its sufficient if we are replacing the OS ROM, and using
the intelligent RAM disc, or the homebrew 512K one, plus floppies

The PX4 has a parallel port, can we run an SD card off it ?
