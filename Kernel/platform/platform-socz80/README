This is the target for the SocZ80 128MHz FPGA Z80 platform.

At this point in time it supports the following components

- timer
- ramdiscs
- SD card
- two serial ports (USB virtual and native) (currently not quite working)

It does not support
- speed setting on the uarts with the newer FPGA firmware
- Other SPI interfaces
- Ethernet
- Flash memory
- Real time clock

This port is currently slightly bitrotted. It needs adapting to the BANK16K
MMU mapping logic and the new style map_* interfaces that pass the page
array in HL.

This port is heavily based upon (and mostly consists of) code by Will
Sowerbutts.



MMU
---

The MMU has 4K pages, but we use them in 16K blocks. It also supports both
read-only pages and an MMU bypass for copying memory. The read-only bit
isn't yet used but ought to be used to protect kernel space. The bypass mode
is used and any code using it *MUST* not use it from an IRQ or if it does
must save/restore it properly.
