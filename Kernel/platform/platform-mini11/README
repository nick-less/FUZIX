Fuzix for the Mini11 68HC11 SBC

This is a 68HC11, 16K of ROM at C000-FFFF (pageable) and 512K of RAM wired
directly to the CPU address lines and some port A lines, so a full 64K switch.
The only things not switched are the internal memory and I/O plus the ROM.

The normal setup is an SD card on the SPI and the onboard serial at 9600 baud
with an 8MHz clock.

Memory mapping

Kernel (bank 0)
	0x0000-0x00FF	Direct page (kernel)
	0x0100-0x01FF	Loader space for now (can be reclaimed later)
	0x0200-0xEFFF	Kernel
	0xF000-0xF03F	Internal I/O (only I/O)
	0xF040-0xF1FF	Internal common RAM (but only 256 bytes on 68HC11Ax)
	0xF200-0xFDFF	Kernel and common code
	0xFE00-0xFEFF	SCI serial buffers (set in mini11.S)
	0xFFE0-0xFFFF	Vectors

In user space

	0x0000-0x00FF	Direct page (user)
	0x0100-0xEFFF	User space
	0xF000-0xF03F   Internal I/O
	0xF040-0xF1FF	Internal RAM (unbankable)
	0xF200-0xFFDF	Commonm code
	0xFFE0-0xFFFF	Vectors

This requires a thunked 68HC11 model. We pack helper data in the common
memory and as we have to so little we copy common code into each bank to
have the same effect.

TODO

Would it make sense to compact the DP usage and overlap the udata at
0x0080 in the kernel map with kernel DP at 0x00 ? This would turn a lot
of accesses into DP mode

Move udata copy up high if have space and split the swap (gives us more
bytes of user map)

Optimize fork and other copiers. Several could be a chunk faster with
more self modifying code

Add SPI mux support and WizNet 5500 for internet
