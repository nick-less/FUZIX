ZX Evolution (baseconf)

I/O Mapping

The ZX Evolution has two oddities here. Firstly it inherits a lot of the
ZX Spectrum 16bit wide port decode hacks. Secondly it has a shadow and non
shadow mode and some ports are present only in one mode.

- Implementation rule for Fuzix, you must have DI on for shadow mode. Also
  standard sys functions may turn shadow off if used (notably mapping)

Memory

512K ROM, 4MB RAM.


Memory Map:

0000-BFFF: Kernel
C000-FFFF: Kernel/Common (we stick to 48K apps to get a bigger kernel)

0000-BFFF: User
C000-FFFF: Kernel/Common

We will need to push disk buffers into their own bank and we have banks for
video as well. But we have 4MB so who cares. Reworking the port for bigger
user apps can occur later

More interesting question: would we be better off using bankfixed or thunked ?


TODO
- Figure out how the boot logic works
- Write a boot loader
- Correct the set up code to set turbo and video etc right
- Look at the other bits of port BF and how to use without getting in a mess
- xx77 is even worse
- Go through and sort out shadow v non shadow
- Set up the IDE and SD ports and code
- Add external buffer support to devsd
- External buffers
- Graphics modes setting and mapping
- UDG and font loads
- Floppy driver including adding external buffer support
- RTC
- PS/2 config and keyboard control ?
- What to do with all that RAM ?
- Video mapping into user space - do we support a top at 0x7FFF and direct
  video map choice ?
- Longer term look at memory options - thunked might be worth it to get big
  user processes
