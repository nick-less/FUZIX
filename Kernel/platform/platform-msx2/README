Fuzix for MSX2/2+/TurboR

Current status
	Boots to shell and runs some userland utils.
	There are some video glitches in real hardware not visible in the emulator.
	MegaSD support, no floppy driver. RTC support.
	Keyboard support for international, Japan, UK, and Spanish layouts.

	Only one memory mapper can be used at the moment. Not sure is possible to use
	more than one because of performance penalty due to full slot/subslot 
	switching compared to just ram page switching. Maybe feasible in TurboR.

	Switches to R800 CPU ROM mode on boot if available.

TODO/Ongoing
	Switch to banked memory model - say
		3,2,1,4
		3,0,5,4
	I/O: need a mostly asm megasd transfer routine to speed it up more
	Sunrise CF-IDE interface
	put buffers, tty queues (grow to 256 bytes) into bank space
	VDP1 driver so you can use it with MSX1 + mapper
	Graphics mode support and hooks
	Floppy drivers
	Swap

Running in real hardware

	You need an MSX2 with a memory mapper with at least 128K RAM and a
	MegaFlashROM with SD card interface.

	Build and copy the kernel (fuzix.ascii8.rom) to an sdcard or to a floppy disk
	and flash it from MSX-DOS using the OPFXSD tool.

	Make sure you use OPFXSD v1.13 or later.

	The mapper type should be detected automatically and reported as ascii8.

	### WARNING: do not flash fuzix as the main kernel ###

	When flashing is complete, insert an sdcard containing a fuzix filesystem
	and reboot.

	You can build and generate a fuzix filesystem image using the tool
	'build-filesystem' which can found in ./Standalone.

Running in openmsx:

	You need a modern snapshot of openmsx, openmsx-0.11.0 and higher
	contains sd card emulation bugs that have been fixed as a result of
	fuzix development.

	Before using openmsx you need to set up your MegaFlashROM_SCC+_SD emulated
	interface so that it can be detected by Fuzix. You need a MSX-DOS hdd image
	that can boot from the IDE interface. Copy inside opfxsd.com, nextor.rom,
	dskrom.rom, romdisk.dsk and recovery.rom, then start openmsx with both IDE
	and MegaFlashROM_SCC+_SD extensions. From MSX-DOS flash the interface
	as described in the MegaFlashROM user manual.

	To run FUZIX just do:

	# openmsx -extb MegaFlashROM_SCC+_SD -carta fuzix.ascii8.rom -extc debugdevice -hda fuzixfs.img -machine Panasonic_FS-A1GT

	It should detect the MegaSD interface in slot 2-3

	If you want to use CBIOS that should also work providing fuzix is the
	slot a cartridge.
