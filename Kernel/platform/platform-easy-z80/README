Fuzix for the Easy-Z80 RC2014 compatible board

This is a more minimal build aimed at an EasyZ80 without much extra hardware.
For a full featured but bigger and slower build you can also boot the RC2014
target.

Supported Hardware
	Easy-Z80 card or compatible
	The RC2014 CF card interface, or compatible at 0x10.

	Options:
	Floppy Drive Interface
	DS1302 RTC at 0xC0
	RC2014 Joystick
	PPIDE (instead of CF interface)

Things To Note When Modifying

  * Space is very tight. The kernel must finish below C000 and the rest goes
    above the common line.
  * Do not move discard below C300 on a 16K banking setup. There is stuff in
    start.c that requires that C000-C2FF space is free for starting init from
    the kernel.
  * Only IM2 capable hardware is supported and no interrupting non IM2 hardware
    can be in the system when used this way.

Things that don't work

  * Flow control isn't yet enabled for the serial port.
  * Swap (it's there but it's most certainly not debugged or wired up fully)

Setting It Up

make diskimage
Boot the resulting disk

For emulation

rc2014 -b -r EZ80_std.rom -m easyz80 -i emu-ide.img   (-R for RTC)
