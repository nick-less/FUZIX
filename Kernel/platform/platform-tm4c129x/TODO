*	syscall return path should check for signals and push a signal frame
*	interrupt return path should check for signals and push a signal frame
*	interrupt return path should check for pre-emption and task switch
	if need be. As it's a flat model that is nice and simple with no
	ugly stack contortions.

*	Should probably of course run priv/user mode and use the memory
	protections

*	No swap in flat mode - this is a general issue which needs a flat like
	buddy allocator model to keep things sane
