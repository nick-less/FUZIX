Minimal Initial Support for Bill Shen's Z280RC

This is a port in progress. It doesn't work yet.


Z280RC is a Z280 based SBC with limited support for RC2014 peripherals. Only
8bit I/O port access to the bus is supported and IM2 cannot be used. In
practice this isn't much of a limitation as the Z280RC is self contained for
all things that matter.

Requirements

Z280RC SBC

Supported

Z280 on board UART as console
Z280 on board timers for clock tick and baud rate (NEITHER DONE YET)
16bit IDE/CF adapter on the board

Not Supported (initially)

Z280 processor modes
Virtual memory
Proper paging
Split I/D


Memory Map

We fake up a Z80 with banked memory and use the MMU to create 8 (for now)
user banks with the top 8K common and the rest per bank, plus a kernel bank
that is the full 64K identity mapped.

User Mode

0000-00FF	Z80 vectors and RST
0100-DDFF	User code
DE00-DFFF	udata stash
E000-EFFF	Unused
F000-FFFF	Common space (lots of room left)

Kernel Mode

0000-00FF	Z80 vectors and RST
0100-????	Kernel
????-EFFF	Buffers
F000-FFFF	Common space (lots of room left)

No external peripherals are currently supported.
