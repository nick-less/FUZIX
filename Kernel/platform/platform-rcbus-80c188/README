Initial sketching work for 8086 to test user builds and the like

The kernel is very early days but the platform itself is

80C188
512K RAM	(low half)
512K ROM	(high half)
RCbus CF adapter	(0x10 8bit)
RCbus 16x50 serial	(0xC0)

(and maybe some other bits as we go like the FDC)

It does not (currently) have any kind of PC BIOS, video or keyboard
controller, although a PS/2 style keyboard interface card does exist
