At the moment this is just build testing and seeing what in the toolchain
breaks.

Once it all builds and the syscall and some minimal driver code is filled in
it ought to come in at about 20KW for a pure swap based system so probably
not useful on an MMUless /11 except for testing.

Boot notes:
	start block with nop apparently sometimes needed
	Generally first block, but on rx appears to be first sector of track 1
	(not 0 as expected)

Boot logic:
	Load inode 1 (hardcoded offset)
	Walk direct link blocks looking for /bootstrap
	Load only direct blocks of the referenced inode

	Run /bootstrap
