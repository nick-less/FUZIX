A Try to run on a commodore pet 8296
based on rc2014-6502

the 8296 has 64k of base ram and 64k of expansion ram, the expansion ram is available in four 16k pages
which can be mapped to 0x8000 (page 0 and 1) and 0xc000 (page 2 and 3)
The system starts in PET Mode where only the first 32k ram are are available.
Enabling the full 64k requires the setting of some jumpers (ju3, ju4 and ju5) to enable program control over the
full 64k ram.
the mapping is then done by a combination of the expansion Register CR0 and VIA Port A, bits 0 to 2.

The memory map is than
0x0000 - 0x7fff ram
0x8000 - 0x8fff screen buffer
0x9000 - 0xffdf ram
0xff80 - 0xff8f ide
0xfff0 - 0xfff0 expansion register
0xfff1 - 0xffff ram  (vectos)

VIA Port A
; BIT 
; 0 - RAM_SELA  - enables base ram at 0xa000
; 1 - RAM_SEL9 -  enables base ram at 0x9000
; 2 - RAM_ON - enables base ram in place of system roms


0xfff - CR0: this is the memory extension register, its write only 
;  BIT 
;  0 - 1 = WriteProtect $8000 - $BFFF
;  1 - 1 = WriteProtect $C000 - $FFFF
;  2+3     0 0:  2 and 0,  0 1:  2 and 1
;          1 0:  3 and 0,  1 1:  3 and 1
;  4 - 1 = reserved
;  5 - 1 = Screen peek $8000-$8FFF 
;  6 - 1 = I/O peek $E800-$E9FF  
;  7 - 1 = enable memory expansion (i.e. the top 32k are replaced by expansion memory, see bits 2+3)
;

the 8296 only supports IEEE Drives, luckily I have build an IDE Adapter which I will use for the first tries


Interrupts deal wth the shared ZP by swapping the ZP back and forth with the
interrupt copies (about 20 bytes involved)


IO:  only mapped when accessed by enabling IO peek or screen peek
    8000-8FFF   Screen Memory (for pages)
    E810-E81F		6520 PIA1
    E820-E83F		6520 PIA2
    E840-E87F		6522 VIA
    E880-E8FF		6548 CRT



Memory map:
	0000-00FF		Zero page
	0100-01FF		Stack
	0200-1FFF		Common, constants, cc65 support code
	2000-3FFF		Initial and discardable boot time
	4000-FEFF		Kernel
	FF00-FFFF		Vectors (mostly free)


User space:
	0000-00FF		Zero page
	0100-01FF		Stack
	0200-1FFF		Common, constants, cc65 support code
	2000-7FFF		still part of kernel(?)
	8000-FEFF		User space
	FF00-FFFF		Vectors (mostly free)

The memory banks are allocated as follows

	0,2 Kernel (0 is not fully available?)
	1,3 User 



The 6502 port has some interesting gotchas to be aware of and things that
need addressing

- We share the zero page and stack between user and kernel. The interrupt
  path either has to have its own bank or copy/restore some state to make
  interrupt handling in C work. For this port we don't waste 16K on an
  interrupt bank but we could in theory. Whilst the 6502 hardware stack is
  a precious resource the compiler makes little use of it so this seems to
  be fine.

- The common area is duplicated into each process common space. This means
  any writes to this area are effectively process specific. For the udata it
  is exactly what we want, for other things be careful.

- There is a direct relationship between kernel and user on some ZP usage. In
  particular the user C stack zero page locations are used by the kernel to
  access arguments. The relocator ensures the kernel and user share the C
  stack ZP locations so the applications are portable.

- Signals are tricky. The C stack is maintained via ZP and is 16bits. As there
  is no way to know if the stack was mid update an interrupt cannot tell if
  the C stack is valid. The signal handlers deal with this by moving 256 bytes
  down the C stack which should always land in a safe spot even if mid update.

- Great care is taken to ensure nothing assumes ZP is at 0. On some 65C816
  systems it won't be.

- System calls are done via a JSR. BRK may look good but it's not reliable on
  NMOS 6502 parts.

- The cc65 support code is of reasonable size and actually the same for user
  and kernel code. Some kind of shared library scheme for it would make
  binaries a lot smaller.

- There is minimal support for 65C816. The entire OS runs in 8bit 6502 mode
  except for using MVN in fork, and some bits in the C library where setjmp
  and longjmp need a minimal awareness of 65C816.

TODO:
Swap support
Look at other RC2014 device support

Real System:

Burn the ROM from the RC2014 ROM archive into a 512K flash if you don't already
have it on the system

make diskimage

copy disk.img onto a CF adapter. The current image is about 40MB (mostly empty)
and can be written to anything that size or larger.

Insert CF card into system and power up.

If you see just a letter 'R' on the console at 38400 baud then something is
wrong with the system set up. If it is working you will get a copyright
message and a set of debug as it loads from CF.

Emulator:

Build the ROM image as before
Copy emu-ide.img somewhere

./rc2014-6502 -1 -r 6502.rom -i emu-ide.img

Add -R to enable an emulation of the RC2014 RTC card, add -w for the
WizNet 830MJ.
