This is Fuzix for the Z180ITX RC2014 system booting from ROMWBW.

Based upon the N8VEM Mark IV port by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Required:
- Z180ITX motherboard

Options:
 - RC2014 CF adapter at 0x10

Not yet supported but planned:
 - Video
 - Keyboard/mouse
 - RC2014 TMS9918A
 - Swap
 - RTC

To set up

make diskimage
Write the disk.img file to disk
Boot ROMWBW and at the boot prompt give the number of the device to boot from
(SD or CF)

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

TODO:
- Add "turbo" option for clock doubling
- Add wait state control option for mem/io/cf wait states
- More CF testing
- Can we do CF with DMA1 ? (ought to get us to 3MBytes/second which is about the
PIO 0 limit with 0 mem 1 ide wait). 36MHz would get us closer to 6 but less
due to wait stating so probably ok as PIO1.
- Detect ROMWBW version and set baud rate

Z180MiniITX TODO:
Floppy: need to debug hang if no disk, need to work out how to support multiple
addresses for plug in card option.
SD: Multiple SD possible and different CS lines (scans 0 and 1 for now)
PS2 keyboard/mouse
Joystick
I2C bus
Different RTC
Use RTC NVRAM to identify slots etc (DS1307+)
56 bytes NVRAM
