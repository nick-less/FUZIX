68K Nano

A ROM based build for the 68K nano system. We build in ROM because it was
easier than rewriting the monitor. The vectors are in ROM space and we'd need
to rewrite the monitor to revector them anyway to make things work.

It would work RAM based with some small adjustments and with revectoring
and a more clean boot ROM could then probably boot CP/M-68K, EHBASIC or
FUZIX as desired.

Memory Map:

000000-0FFFFF	64K ROM repeating
900000-9XXXXF	CF adapter (16bit wide but the designer didn't swap the
		upper and lower bytes in hardware)
A00000-AXXXXF	UART (16x50)
C00000-CFFFFF	RAM

All other addresses are unusable or empty (8xxxxxxx is empty)

The 16x50 is also used as the interrupt controller and as GPIO lines which
run an SPI interface to an RTC. It interrupts on autovector 1
