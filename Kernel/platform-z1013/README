An initial cut at Fuzix for the Z1013 with a 32K switchable EPROM. The OS
image is mostly in the ROM and paged in and out as needed. The rest of it
(which must match build) is loaded off the first sectors of the disk which
expects to have a PC style partition table.

(Figuring out how to nicely play with CP/A is a project for later)

Currently assumes
- 32K switchable EPROM (no option to use 128K RAM modern setup)
- GIDE
- RTC (on the GIDE)
- Keyboard is handled via the monitor to deal with all the variants (you won't
get too far without a fuller keyboard unless someone wants to write an extended
32key driver with a control key setting)
- RAM floppy at 0x58

For the -128K blue the jumpers needed are ideally
	JP8  2-3		Or set it by hand before doing J 8000
	JP11 1-2		D5 pages in EPROM

(the 128K second bank is not currently used so not relevant)

As configured it uses LBA hard disk and only scans for the first disk. This
is needed to work around the lack of LBA emulation in JKCEMU and some bugs in
the JKCEMU GIDE emulation.

make diskimage
load the generated fuzix.rom as the 32K pageable EPROM
load the diskimage as the GIDE first disk

Boot and in the monitor set the EPROM paged in if needed and then J 8000

TODO: although the memory space left is tight so this may be limited without
      doing a thunked 128K build as well as this one

- Optional SD card bitbanged on port A
- Optional external timer interrupt / interruptor on port A.
- Video mode switching (64 x 16 optional 64 x 32)
- Floppies

Note that the system does not have a standard interval timer interrupt so is
somewhat limited by this behaviour.

Memory map

User mode
0000-00FF		Monitor space
0100-5FFF		Common, kernel data, buffers, etc
6000-DFFF		User space
E000-EBFF		Unused for now (may extend user)
EC00-EFFF		Video
F000-FFFF		Monitor ROM (jump table required)

Kernel mode
0100-5FFF		Common, kernel data, buffers, etc
8000-EBFF		ROM fuzix code
EC00-EFFF		Video
F000-FFFF		Monitor ROM (jump table required)

The system runs with single process in memory for obvious reasons


Address 4 bits
	Peters		128K
7: set for 64x16	Unused
6: set for 4MHz		set for 4MHz
5: alt font		page ROM
4: OS ROM enabled	OS ROM enabled (also enables video)

without OS ROM enabled EC00-FFFF bleed through to ROM or RAM
