Fuzix for Tom's SBC version C in 64K EPROM (preferably an erasable one as
this will change a lot!)

This is a port to Tom's SBC. 

The only modification is to bend up DCDA on the SIO-2 and wire it to a
8Hz square wave source. The board as designed has no timer source as CP/M
2.2 doesn't actually need one. There are plenty of ways to make an 8Hz
square wave circuit, including these days just using one of the tiny PIC
devices to count it.

(Other frequencies will do but I happen to own an 8Hz source). Set the
clock frequency in config.h and fiddle as needed with devtty.c as the
kernel needs to see a clock divisible by 10 so some fudging is done).

Memory map

Kernel

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in all banks)
0100-3FFF	Kernel (four banks)
4000-BFFF	User space
C000-FFFF	All kernel data common and stacks

User

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-BFFF	User space
C000-FFFF	Kernel data command and stacks

BUGS

TO DO
Push the data and common up higher
Maybe support the CP/M emulator
Swap only needed blocks for speed up
(The ideal case of 128K RAM + banked ROM kernel would need a banked thunked
 Z80 setup which we don't yet support and would be a little bit too
 interesting right now!)


Emulation

make diskimage

searle -r fuzix.rom -T -i emu-ide.img -t

Real Hardware

Burn the 64K ROM image and fit the EEPROM or Flash
make diskimage

Write the disk image to CF
