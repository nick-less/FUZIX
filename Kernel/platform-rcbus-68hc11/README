Fuzix for RCBUS with the following configuration
	68HC11 CPU card:
		CPU configuration: 68HC11 with ROM, EEPROM, COP disabled.
	512K RAM/ROM card:
	5v SD card adapter attached to the SPI port. CS on port D 0x20
	and/or IDE CF adapter at I/O 0x10

	(Lots of other cards should work but they are not yet supported)

Memory mapping

	0x0000-0x00BF	Direct page (user)
	0x00C0-0x00FF	Direct page (kernel)
	0x0100-0x01FF	Loader space for now (can be reclaimed later)
	0x0200-0xBFFF	Kernel
	0xC000-0xEFFF	User space chunk of the common copy
	0xF000-0xF03F   Internal I/O (other possible place)
	0xF040-0xF1FF	Internal RAM (unbankable)
	0xF200-0xFDFF	Common data and whatever code fills the rest
	0xFE00-0xFEFF	I/O
	0xFF00-0xFFDF	Maybe move istack here ?
	0xFFE0-0xFFFF	Vectors

In user space

	0x0000-0x00BF	Direct page (user)
	0x00C0-0x00FF	Direct page (kernel)
	0x0100-0xEFFF	User space
	0xF000-0xF03F   Internal I/O
	0xF040-0xF1FF	Internal RAM (unbankable)
	0xF200-0xFDFF	Common data and whatever code fills the rest
	0xFE00-0xFEFF	I/O
	0xFF00-0xFFDF
	0xFFE0-0xFFFF	Vectors

Hardware Arrangement

68HC11 CPU
FE00-FEFF hardwired as an I/O window that generates Z80 I/O cycles 0-FF on the
RCBUS bus
512K RAM/ROM (eventually should be able to also switch to the flat model)
Internal UART

Things to address
- Dynamic buffer allocation
- Proper two level interrupt handling so that the timer drives Fuzix and
  the other stuff is queued
- Don't disable all interrupts in the Fuzix paths
- Add device support for some of the RCBUS external devices

Emulation:

ROM is in the RCBUS ROM package
