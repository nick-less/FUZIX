This is an initial cut at a Fuzix image for the Rhyophyre.

The core system is fairly generic. It's a Z180, 1MB of RAM, some ROM and the usual
Retrobrew PPIDE and RTC interfaces. There's a simple control latch and a VT82C42
PS/2 port as well.

The big part of the system is the NEC7220 graphics. This is not yet supported at all
as it's a major new piece of work whilst the rest is basically a paste together of
existing supported devices.

The current gen1 board does not support SPI via the CSIO which means there is no
ability to add an SD card or to support TCP/IP via the WizNET devices. You could
in theory do this by stealing some of the spare or borrowable I/O pins (eg the
flow control for the second serial).

TODO:
Support the NEC7220 consoles
Look at adjusting the various resources to match memory
