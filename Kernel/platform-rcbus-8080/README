RCBUS 8080

Initial support for pure 8080 on the 8085 CPU/MMU + 16550A UART card setup
using RCBUS.

TODO: from compiler change (checked on other ports)
- fprintf of a -1 int seems to produce nonsense - casting bug somewhere ?

Supported Hardware

	Etched Pixels 80C85/MMU card with CPU and MMU
	512K linear RAM/ROM card (Small computer central SC119, Tom Szolyga,
	Marten Feldtmann, Rotten Snow #68) etc. *NOT* the Z80 banked memory
	card.
	A 16Cx50 based serial adapter at 0xC0
	PPIDE at 0x20

	A clock source. Either the 82C54 card at 0x3C or a TMS9918A with
	interrupt enabled at 0x98/0x99. If you are using the rev3 or earlier
	board note the erratum and use a diode not a jumper for the IRQ

Options
	RCBUS DS1302 card at 0x0C

To Enable
	ACIA at 0xA0			(in progress)
	Joystick at 0x01/0x02
	More serial ports
	TMS9918A as console maybe ? (what to do for keyboard ? - PS2)
	TMS9918A extended features?
	Swap on PPIDE (ditto 8085)

Unsupported
	Z80 support chip based devices (SIO, CTC, PIO, DMA)
	IDE CF adapter (unreliable especially with higher CPU speed)
	RCBUS Banked 512K RAM/ROM card
	Hardware that uses the full 16bit I/O address space

	For hardware requiring the standard RCBUS clock it is possible to
	run with an 8MHz Tundra 80C85-8 part and a crystal at double the
	classic speed.


RCbus 8080 Addresses for I/O

At this point:

0x0C		DS1302
0x20-0x23	PPIDE
0x3C-0x3F	82C54
0x70-0x7F	RAM/ROM card banking control
0x98-0x99	TMS9918A
0xA0-0xA7	ACIA (to add)
0xC0-0xC7	16550A UART

To Build

Use cc85 from the Fuzix compiler kit

make diskimage will produce an IDE disk image (40MB mostly empty) and a matching
emulator disk image (emu-ide.img).

If you are building it yourself or updating the bootloader from the ROM package
goes on block 0 (with partition table), the kernel goes on blocks 1+ with the
file system and PC partition tables as normal.

The emulator image can be run with

rcbus-8085 -1 -r 512-8085.rom -B -I emu-ide.img -R

but note that there is currently no timer emulation so there will be no
timer interrupts and some behaviour will be very odd under emulation.
