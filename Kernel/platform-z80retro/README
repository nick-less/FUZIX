Z80Retro		https://github.com/peterw8102/Z80-Retro

A Z80 retro board built around the usual Zilog components and a bitbang SD
interface. Optional Z80 PIO card add on. It's much like many of the 
Retrobrew/RC2014 style setups with 4 x 16K banked RAM.

Optional video card (not handled) with 8bit I/O port as well suitable
for a maxtrix keyboard etc

Supported:
Serial
CTC timers (CTC is required)

TODO:
video card (+ matrix keyboard ?)
Multiple SD cards (needs tinysd improving)
I2C bus and DS1307

Do we want a separate buffer bank and lots of buffers given bitbang SD ?
(could pinch from easyz80). Would need this for video option really as have
to load a 4K font.
Or banked with Wiznet 5500 on an SD

Boot

The ROM is a bit peculiar. It ignores PC partitioning type rules and just
splats its own boot magic there. Might be better to port RomWBW but for
now we just make ourselves our own ROM image instead.

There is no swap - it's doable easily enough but there's enough RAM for a
single user setup easily and swap would be painful as well as really needing
interrupt pre-emption support adding to Z80 (which will happen but not just
yet).

Serial

Because the serial runs at 115,200 baud the system runs with the serial input
side entirely interrupt driven and in common space. It costs us a little common
memory but that's not a resource we are short of and avoids any bank switch
costs servicing the SIO vectors.

The timer does currently block the serial interrupt and it's not clear there
is much we can do about it easily.
