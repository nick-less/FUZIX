Fuzix development branch for the (currently unfinished) RCbus
NS32K board.

Flat ROM in the low 32K, RAM follows.

I/O via RCbus devices with the I/O window mapped as 00F0XXXX

Devices in emulator
- IDE at 0x10 (shadow 0x90)
- PPIDE at 0x20
- 16x50 (interrupt driven) at 0xC0
- RTC at 0x0C
- Wiznet at 28

No MMU, no vectored interrupt controller, need to add a timer
tick source.

Status
-	PS is broken - check user v kernel for ps changes. alignment etc

Things To Do

Kernel Side
DONE - Signal handling (but check all regs right)
- Exception handlers (sketched ones don't match signal code any more)
- Wire up an emulated timer
- Check how we should handle trace/trap bits and interrupts
- Understand what FPU would involve
- non split I/D pure - don't copy all of segment 0

User Side
DONE - Debug setjmp/longjmp
