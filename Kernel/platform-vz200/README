Lazer VZ200 with 128K + SD card

Memory map:
0000-3FFF	ROM (fixed)	[there is a mod to use this as RAM]
4000-67FF	Populated by one of two banks from SD card SRAM
6800-6FFF	I/O latches and keyboard
7000-77FF	Video RAM (may be paged on modded machines). Only low
		512 used in normal text mode. Contended access causes display
		noise.
7800-8FFF	Onboard memory (not paged)
9000-FFFF	Two SRAM banks off 128K card

Kernel
4000-67FF	Kernel low (two banks)
7000-71FF	Video
7200-77FF	Video space (starts as part of discard)
7800-87FF	Common (only discard overlaps non text video)
9000-FEFF	Kernel main (ideally 9000-FEFFF so can get bigger user space)
FF00-FFFF	IM2 hack

User
8000-FFFF	User space
7000-71FF	Video

TODO: Finish loader, and start debug

Video

The floppy interface is not supported. This shouldn't matter as the floppies
are weird, incredibly slow and the floppy DOS will clash with the SD.

Interrupts:
The system ROM jumps to 0x787D. This is smack in the middle of our common space
so we will need to do some magic around the system variables spot.

Memory:

Memory is incredibly tight, especially in the common space. Do not add stuf without
careful checking.

DISCARD starts at 7200 so we can throw it for video
COMMON follows it and must start at above 7880
COMMON must end before 8800 (start of user)
The two banked code segments must fit between 4000 and 6AFF
The main code segment must fit between 9000 and FFFF

In order to get interrupts sane we disable interrupts on boot and keep them off
until user space has started, at which point we blow away discard which leaves
7800-787F free, along with the rest of video and probably some more above 7800 we
have no particular use for. We then write our handler into 787D in the usual fashion
except that we undo the ROM behaviour and jump to our code so we can pre-empt properly
and so on.

Post boot all the video space is free. So for a normal machine the usual video modes
are available. If we do a variant for banked video setups then this ought to work too
as we can do all our boot time games, but we can also use the upper 2K of the 8K video
RAM to hold a font and maybe some simple renders to use full text mode.

Flicker may be a big problem though.
