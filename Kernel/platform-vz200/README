Lazer VZ200 with 128K + SD card

Memory map:
0000-3FFF	ROM (fixed)	[there is a mod to use this as RAM]
4000-67FF	Populated by one of two banks from SD card SRAM
6800-6FFF	I/O latches and keyboard
7000-77FF	Video RAM (may be paged on modded machines). Only low
		512 used in normal text mode
7800-8FFF	Onboard memory (not paged)
9000-FFFF	Two SRAM banks off 128K card

Kernel
4000-67FF	Kernel low (two banks)
7000-71FF	Video
7200-7FFF	Common (overlaps non text video)
9000-FFFF	Kernel main (ideally 9000-FFFF so can get bigger user space)

User
8000-FFFF	User space
7000-71FF	Video

Video

The actual machine only has two video modes. Our use of 71FF to 7FFF prevents
the use of the graphics mode but this is not a great loss. There are a bunch
of graphics extensions that page an 8K SRAM and allow all the extended video
modes. This can probably be made to work by switching between the top 2K of
the 8K RAM for Fuzix use and (carefully) the other banks to do video updates.
As only 6K is used for video this ought to work out fine.

The floppy interface is not supported. This shouldn't matter as the floppies
are weird, incredibly slow and the floppy DOS will clash with the SD.
