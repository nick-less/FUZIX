Just initial sketches. Nothing tested yet.

Memory Map

0000 - 00FF		Vectors			}
0100 - E7FF		User Space		}	Banked Area
E600 - E7FF		udata stash		}
E800 - EFFF		Common space		}
F000 - F7FF		ROM
F800 - FBFF		Video
FC00 - FFFF		Udata and common data (unbanked block)

Once we have a vaguely sensible port and the split banking we need to move
things around a bit to avoid stacks FC00-FFFF because of video contention.
However that means switching to the thunked model (as the SC108 uses)

Target Hardware

Nascom I/II/III or maybe Gemini GM811/813 (is the 813 a variant port ?)
(likewise MAP80 might be)

Required:
Nascom I/II/II
	192K "page mode" RAM (may be able to do a 128K port as well) eg
	RAM64/GM802
	GM816 or compatible 58174 clock at 0x20

Options:
	GM833 Ramdisc. Driver written, also steals up to 1MB of it for
	swap if no other swap partition is found on disk. The full theoretical
	8MB is supported although 2MB was the most practically possible

	GM809/29/49/49A Floppy. Initial driver code done

	GM829/49/49A SASI/SCSI. Initial driver code done


Boot Loaders Needed
-	Nascom Floppy
-	MAP80 VFC
-	Gemini FDC
-	Gemini SASI/SCSI
-	Probably a CP/M boot loader for the other cases



Options:
Nascom AVC	(384x256 / 768x256)	(can be jumpered for Vblank port A bit1)
Nascom Floppy Controller
Nascom I/O card (PIO, CTC, UART)
	Mostek 3882 CTC (Z80 CTC)
	6402 UART
	MK3881 PIO	(Z80 PIO)

GM805 'Henelec' single density floppy
GM810 IVC
GM816 (CTC 3x PIO optional serial GM818 - dual 8250)
GM822 RTC over PIO ?
GM832 SVC
GM837 Climax Colour
BE847 Maths card
GM848 quad serial
GM862 RAM
MAP80 256K RAM
MAP80 MPI (serial, CTC, FDC, SASI) ?
MAP80 VFC
WT625 Viewdata
Other RTC options (some RTC have 2Hz or so interrupt - not much use but
better than nothing - it'll get you out of a stuck process loop)
