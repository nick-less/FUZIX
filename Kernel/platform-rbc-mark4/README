This is Fuzix for the RBC (ex N8VEM) Mark IV SBC
By Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Supported hardware:
 - Real time clock
 - IDE interface
 - SD interface
 - RS232 serial port (ASCI channel 0, tty1)
 - RS422 serial port (ASCI channel 1, tty2)
 - PropIO V2 serial port (tty3, optional)

The PropIO V2 can be enabled by editing config.h and setting PROPIO2_IO_BASE to
the base IO port address of the board. If enabled, the PropIO will be used as
the system console.

To build the kernel, edit the TARGET line in Kernel/Makefile to read:
    export TARGET=n8vem-mark4
Then run "make clean; make all" in the "Kernel" directory.

Fuzix now uses the ROMWBW boot system on the Mark IV. Build using
"make diskimage" to get a standard disk.img file you can then boot on the
system and an emulator image you can use with the RC2014 emulator set.
