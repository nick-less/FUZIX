# Fuzix for the Zeta SBC V2

Written by Sergey Kiselev <skiselev@gmail.com>
Heavily based on prior work by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com> and others

## Supported Hardware

- RAM disk
- RS232 serial port (16550 UART, tty1)
- PPIDE hard disk
- Real time clock

## Installation

### Boot From CP/M

Copy "fuzix.com" to your CP/M filesystem. Run it from CP/M, it will boot the
kernel. Requires a reasonably large TPA.

### Boot From UNA BIOS

The disk image built includes a UNA compatible boot sector for the PPIDE
drive.

Load the disk into the machine and boot. At the "Boot UNA unit number or ROM?"
prompt, type the number of the disk unit to boot from.

### Boot From Flash ROM

The fuzix.rom image built is a bootable Fuzix kernel without a ROM disk. You
can add a ROM disk or RAM disk by using dd to put a filesystem into the 512K
ROM image generated by make diskimage after the kernel (64K to 512K)

See Notes.md for more information

## Not Supported
