Commodore 128 in Z80 mode

Initial bring up code

Disk Images

The image build needs ctools
https://techtinkering.com/articles/transferring-files-to-and-from-cpm-d71-disk-images-using-ctools/

Tested
- Boot up from CP/M
- Initialise memory
- Initialise simple 40 column text
- Video

Done (in debug)
- Interrupt handling. Needs fleshing out to use the right timers (screw bitbang 300
  baud serial).
- Keyboard (seems to scan ok, need shift table setting)
- SD card (hangs probing here)
- Basic probing of Georam and REU
- Sizing of Georam

To Do
- Optimize keyboard (spot all rows up on a fast poll - a trick we should do
 on TRS80 and ZX machines too!). Init keyboard with a scan at boot
- Sizing of REU
- Sprite pointers and memory ?
- 80 column video as tty2 ?
- REU and GeoRAM swap
- IEC anything (printer, floppy, different modes)
- Floppy (can we use the CP/M stuff ?)
- Sound
- Joystick
- Video modes on both chips
- Capslock key
- Running 6502 apps 8)
- 640x200 bitmap mode (with/without colour by sizing video)
- VIC video modes
	-	character mode	video 1000 , sprite pointers, font 2k
	-	multicolour character - same but 20 char wide not 40
	-	standard bitmap 320x200 8K + 1K colour data per char square 
	-	multicolourbitmap 160x200 8K
	-	extended background colour mode 1K + font
- Sprite API

Designed to be booted from CP/M.

Kernel
0000-00FF	Zero page (shared ?)
0100-01FF	Ditto (need to look into this and the MMU switching of page 0 and 1)

E800-EFFF	Font
F000-FFFF	Common

User
0000-00FF	Zero page (shared ?)
0100-01FF	User (investigate MMU issue - might have to make sure kenrel
		0100-01FF is only boot discardables)
0200-EFFF	User
F000-FFFF	Common

with graphics flag need to think about VIC video modes and locations
