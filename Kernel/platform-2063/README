Z80 2063

A fairly simple 32/32 banked 512K RAM machine with the usual top bank pinned
high. Has an SIO and CTC and yet another varianr on bitbang SD that's not
the same as anyone else's. Slightly odd boot arrangement (it loads 16K
from the start of partition 1). We subvert it by making the first 512
bytes of our partition boot block just load the kernel from the proper
place instead.

Boot loader only supports SDHC/SDXC cards in large block mode as that
is all the ROM supports.

Memory Map

Kernel
0000-7FFF	Kernel code (must not contain data or const data)
8000-..		Kernel code end, constants, data, buffers
F000-F03F	IM2 vectors
F040-F23F	Udata
F240-FDFF	Common code
FE00-FFFF	SIO buffer (must be page aligned)

User
0000-7DFF	User process
7E00-7FFF	Udata copy

Strange Stuff To Note

The SD interface and the bank select are on the same I/O bits. This means
that you have to lock out bank switching whilst bitbanging GPIO to get any
bearable SD speed. The kernel does this by keeping the serial handlers and
buffers unbanked and by counting CTC interrupts it can't service during an
SD bitbang and catching up on them the first CTC interrupt that this isn't
a problem.
