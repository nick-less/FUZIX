;	bit_in
;	passed a port in C, shifts E left, adds the bit to the E register and
;	preserves the previous top bit in carry.
;
;	bit_out
;	sends the low bit of l shifts l right.
;
;	In both cases you need to wait for the clock to go low, act and wait
;	for the clock to return
;
;	On entry the clock and data lines will be floating and the clock
;	should be left floating.
;
;	Register usage
;	C is PORT
;	D is 0xFF (for converting bits to carry)
;	E is the data on receive
;	L is the data on send
;
;	B, E, H, L should be preserved or modified as stated
;	A is scratch. HL' is used by the timeout code.
;
;	-------------------------------------------------
;
;
;	Receive a bit. Wait for the clock to go low, collect the bit, and
;	then wait fro the clock to go high. We add the bit to high and take
;	care to preserve the carry from that shift
;
;	C is the port, IX holds the control structure
;	The bud
