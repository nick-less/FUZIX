The NASCOM machines without CP/M PROM have a memory map of

0000-07FF		Monitor ROM
0800-0BFF		Video	(contended, sparklies)
0C00-0FFF		Work RAM
C000-CFFF		Optional ROM/RAM
D000-DFFF		DOS if fitted (and hard to boot Fuzix otherwise)
E000-FFFF		BASIC ROM

1000-BFFF can be linked to either the 8bit RAM sockets or external RAM

The 48K RAM card recommended settings plxces it at 1000-CFFF, that can be with ROM
or RAM then at D000-DFFF (and usually basic at E000-FFFF). Page mode uses port FF to
select cards. The register resets to 0x11 which enables card 0 for R or W. The upper 4 bits
are a mask for W the lower for R and R/W can differ. Multiple R is bad, multiple W is ok

The third party 64K card occupies the full 64K but the internal RAMDIS logic ensures that
as with the 48K card the monitor/video/work and ROMS win

In CP/M mode the machine takes on an incompatible map with

0000-BFFF		RAM B (can be pageable)
C000-EFFF		Can be off a RAM card or from mainboard ROM/RAM sockets
F000-F7FF		BOOT ROM
F800-FFFF		Video RAM

The other sockets are disabled by default

Not clear we can make anything fit as we only have 0C80-CFFF and no easy way to bank buffers
etc or the kernel.

Hardware Support
Keyboard
Video
Serial
Floppy (nascom or gm ? - WIP)
PIO SD card
Needs 3 or more 48/64K cards in page mode
Must be RAM to E000 (and may want F000 eventually for first bank)
RAM above C000 need not be banked

TODO for CP/M mode
- Finish rewiring nmi key handler
- Look at nmi and int disable check interrupt handling
- Normal interrupt handling for timer on PIO bit
- RTC support with NMI even timing ?
- Figure out CP/M disk format detail
- Bootstrap debug
- Alternative PIO SD bootrom
- Finsh floppy drivers off
