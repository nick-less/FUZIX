Fuzix for the RCBUS system with 6809 processor card

(This is an initial sketch for the port, it does not yet work)

This uses the standard RCBUS cards and mappings. The 6809 card maps the I/O
space on the bus to MMIO $FExx on the 6809 CPU.

The standard 512K RAM card is used with 4x16K bank control. The I/O window
has priority over the memory banking.

For now we use simple banking not 16K paging, this wants fixing once we are
up and running. The map however is arranged roughly as it should end up

Memory map:

User mode
0000-BCFF:		User process
BD00-BEFF:		udata stash
C000-FBFF:		common/kernel
FC00-FDFF:		udata
FE00-FEFF:		I/O
FF00-FFFF:		vectors etc

Kernel mode
0000-FBFF:		common/kernel
FC00-FDFF:		udata
FE00-FEFF:		I/O
FF00-FFFF:		vectors etc

TODO:

DONE	Rework the boot ROM bootstrap checks before starting CUBIX from ROM
	Align crt0 and bootstrap
	Pack and unpack the high space
	Ensure constants end up 0xC000 and higher (.link)
	Timer/VIA set up
	Move istack to FF00-FF??
