Fuzix for the RCBUS system with 6809 processor card

This uses the standard RCBUS cards and mappings. The 6809 card maps the I/O
space on the bus to MMIO $FExx on the 6809 CPU.

The standard 512K RAM card is used with 4x16K bank control.  The I/O window
has priority over the memory banking.  A 6840/6821 card is used to providing
timing.

Memory map:

User mode
0000-BCFF:		User process
BD00-BEFF:		udata stash
C000-FBFF:		common/kernel
FC00-FDFF:		udata
FE00-FEFF:		I/O
FF00-FFFF:		vectors etc

Kernel mode
0000-FBFF:		common/kernel
FC00-FDFF:		udata
FE00-FEFF:		I/O
FF00-FFFF:		vectors etc

Devices

IDE at 0xFE10
6840 at 0xFE60
16x50 UART at 0xFEC0

TODO:
	Move istack to FF00-FF??
	Import the additional mini68k uart work back
	Switch to full 4x16K banking for speed

Devices To Add
-	RTC
-	Joystick
-	PS/2 card
-	80 column card
-	TMS9918A	(and int source ?)
-	SD bitbang on the 6821 GPIO
-	W5100 carrier card if it'll work with the 6809 ?
