pico68k

A small 68000 board with a 6522, 6850 and 68000 plus a small ROM and a
whopping 64 or 128K of RAM. An SD card is wired onto the 6522 VIA A
port as 7 MISO 2 CS 1 CLK 0 MOSI.

TODO:
- Plug a CF into the 6522 instead, but that uses all the lines

This target primarily exists to see how small a machine can run Fuzix 68K and
what is needed with slow I/O. 192K is a lot nicer than 128K. 64K forget it.
