pico68k

A small 68000 board with a 6522, 6850 and 68000 plus a small ROM and a
whopping 64 or 128K of RAM. An SD card is wired onto the 6522 VIA A
port as 7 MISO 2 CS 1 CLK 0 MOSI.

TODO
- Memory model. With flat we can load init and die out of memory.
  Going one process will hurt because the SD is slow
- Plug a CF into the 6522 instead, but that uses all the lines


Not a terribly useful Fuzix machine but handy as an exercise in figuring out 
a viable swap/flat model.
