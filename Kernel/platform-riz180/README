RIZ180

A smaller Z180 setup than usual with only 128K ROM and 128K RAM. Fuzix lives
in ROM on this port. The RIZ180 has the DREQ lines unconnected and the external
interrupt lines pulled high so there is no I/O DMA and only the Z80 style
interrupt is available externally. The SPI port carries TX/RX/CLK vcc and ground,
but is not connected to any chip select, instead the other pin is just a resistor
pulling high.

At the moment the port just boots into Fuzix but it would be easy to add some
code to flip to the upper 64K of the ROM and run a monitor or other tools
such as a ROM based CP/M environment. Fuzix however has to live in the low 64K
so the CBAR can be set up to 1:1 map low memory as the ROM image.

Required:
- RIZ180

Options:
- SD card or Wiznet 5500 on the CSIO SPI using RTS0 for the missing CS line
  (available on point T2 on the left of the board)

To set up

make diskimage
Write the disk.img file to disk
Burn the ROM to the flash

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

Our memory layout:

00:000	Kernel: low 56K ROM bank 0
0E:000	Kernel: initial image of kernel data and common
10:000	Free 64K

RAM low 16K is kernel
40:000
Then 2 x 56K process windows including a 4K common
	(we end up with one 8K repeated chunk)
44:000
51:000	Common
52:000
5F:000	Common

We run with
Low 52K switched, high 4K common copies
In kernel we run
Low 48K direct map 12K paged, 4K common
