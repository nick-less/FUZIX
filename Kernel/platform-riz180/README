RIZ180

A smaller Z180 setup than usual with only 128K ROM and 128K RAM. Fuzix lives
in ROM on this port.

The ROM is set up with the kernel in most of the low space, and the system
monitor/boot support at the top. We need to do it this way as we need the
kernel code in the direct mapped space so we have enough bank registers to
go around (at least for now). Anything else can still run ROM high or ROM
low.

Required:
- RIZ180

Options:
TODO - SD card on SPI
TODO - Wiznet 5500 on SPI

To set up

make diskimage
Write the disk.img file to disk
Burn the ROM to the flash

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

TODO:
- Redo serial tables for slower clock
- Can we do CF with DMA1 ?
- Debug user space accesses to get to the point of loading init

Notes:

Our memory layout for the moment is

00:000	Kernel: low 56K ROM bank 0
0E:000	System ROM space: upper 8K bank 0
10:000	Free 56K
1E:000	Kernel data initialization

RAM low 16K is kernel
40:000
Then 2 x 56K process windows including a 4K common
	(we end up with one 8K repeated chunk)
44:000
51:000	Common
52:000
6F:000	Common

We run with
Low 52K switched, high 4K common copies
In kernel we run
Low 48K direct map 12K paged, 4K common
