Fuzix for the Z80SBC64 and in theory Z80MB64 platforms

Supported Hardware
	RCBUS SBC64 mainboard or MB64 (see notes)
	DS1302 RTC card (need RTC or CTC or both)
	CTC card at 0x88 for SIO timing and for system clock. The CTC card
	must be jumpered for CTC 1 to drive CLK2 and CTC2 zero crossing into
	CTC3. (A CTC is strongly recommended)

	Options
	
	RCBUS Joystick

In Progress
	RCBUS SIO/2 board (or compatible). ACIA is not supported.

	Most other RCBUS cards supported by other platforms should also be
	possible to add	if anyone needs them.

	Suspend to RAM/Resume (basics should work)

Unsupported
	SC110 (no way to run one timer into another which is needed for
	proper timer use without IM2)

Things That Don't Work (yet)
	SIO/2 flow control

Notes
	The Z80MB64 is 22MHz which means there are not yet a CTC for it!
	
Setting It Up

make diskimage

Thi swill produce a bootable disk image and the loader.


Z80SBC64/MB64

Put the jumpers into serial download mode and send Z80SBCLD.BIN as per normal

When it prompts 'Z80BC64 Loader 0.2'
- Send Kernel/platform/loader.ihx
- Type G B000 (only the G is echoed)

You should see

	Configuring booter...Done

	and then the message

	SBC64 Boot Loader
	Loading image from disk...done

You can now power off and change the jumper.

At this point it will report a bad image unless you've created a suitable Fuzix
image on the CF. Fuzix is looking for a standard Fuzix style PC partitioned CF
card with a filesystem partition (7e) and a swap partition (7f). Make sure the
partition table is a modern style one (starting partitions at block 2048 not
block 63).

The kernel image goes at block 2+ on the CF card. With Linux it's a simple matter
of using dd (carefully)

dd if=Kernel/fuzix.bin of=/dev/sdxx bs=512 seek=2 conv=notrunc

Something similar should work on MacOS. People have reported problems with Cygwin
dd on windows but I'm not clear why.

To get back to the CP/M image put the jumper back into serial mode and
follow the download instructions. You will need a different CF card for CP/M as
unfortunately like RCBUS CP/M in general the supplied CP/M does not honour
partition tables.

ZRCC

Insert the disk, boot.

Emulation

Apart from remembering the emulated hard disk has a 1K header all is the same

	./rc2014 -m z80sbc64 -r sbc64.ram -i sbc64.ide -R -c
	./rc2014 -m zrcc -i sbc64.ide -R -c

(and to bootstrap initially copy Z80SBCLD.BIN to sbc64.ram)
