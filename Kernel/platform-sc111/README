This is Fuzix for the SC111 Z180 RC2014 system with a suitable linear RAM/ROM
module such as the SC119 (RAM is expected to fill the upper 512K). If you are
using this CPU card with the classic 512K banked memory setup then use the
rc2014 target instead.

Based upon the N8VEM Mark IV port by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Cards required:
SC111 or similar Z180 CPU interface
SC119 or similar (ROM in low 512K RAM in high 512K) unbanked memory
RC2014 CF IDE

Either RomWBW or SCM 1.3 or later can be used to boot the image, it has boot
loaders for both on the disk.

Supported hardware:
 - RC2014 CF IDE interface

Untested
 - SD card on CSIO port

Not yet supported but planned:
 - RC2014 serial/ctc interfaces (only the onboard ports are handled)
 - RC2014 RTC
 - RC2014 TMS9918A

Experiments pending
 - Using the clock doubler and some wait stating

To set up

make diskimage

In SCM type 'CPM' and instead of CP/M it will boot Fuzix. You can also in
theory run the binary from CP/M but it may be too big to fit.

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

When booting the system from CP/M you can specify the root filesystem device on
the command line after the command name or unit number.

For example, with root filesystem on /dev/hdb1 (minor #17) at the CP/M command
prompt:

    A> FUZIX hdb1
or  A> FUZIX 17
